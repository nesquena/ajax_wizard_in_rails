Overview
========

This will be an example rails application using lowpro, prototype and the animator library which allows 
for you to build a customized computer using a wizard with a series of steps. This is primarily an experiment to create
a sexy javascript based form wizard in Rails.

The basic scenario used to build this is that we want a user-facing application for allowing
computers to be custom ordered and then built similar to dell's online store. In order to achieve
this the client wants a wizard which takes the user through each of the different options
available for the computer, calculates the price and the configuration and then builds
the computer on demand.

Most of this example has now been built to a functioning level although there is still
room for many improvements and the adding of tests. I chose not to test here
because this application is a toy which is purely for experimental purposes
and as such the correctness is of little importance.
