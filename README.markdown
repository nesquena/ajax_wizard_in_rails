Overview
========

This will be an example rails application using lowpro, prototype and the animator library which allows 
for you to build a customized computer using a wizard with a series of steps. This is primarily an experiment to create
a sexy javascript based form wizard in Rails.

Obviously there isn't anything in this repo yet. Stay tuned as I plan to build this out soon.
